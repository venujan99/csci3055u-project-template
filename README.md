## About the language

> _Describe the language_
>
> - History:

Swift is a general purpose, open source programming lanuage that was developed by Apple for iOS, macOS, and Linux. Swift is a fairly new language as it was started by Chris Lattner in 2010. This language got its ideas from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python and C# to name a few. The language was officially used with the first app written in Swift in 2014. Prior to Swift, Apple was using Objective-C as their preferred language.

> - Some Interesting Features:

Swift has a "playground", which is where you can see the result of your code without completely compiling it. This is done through the web browser. It is a live interactive document, which the code executes and results are displayed step-by-step as they are executed. 

## About the syntax

Swift is an alternative language to Objective-C, but has simpler syntax. They say its Obective-C without the "C".

> Sample Snippets of Basic Code

*Creating a Variable*

```swift
var sample_string: String = "Hello World"
```

*Creating an immutable variable*

```swift
let sample_string = "Hello World"
```

*Creating an Array*

```swift
var items = ["Pencil", "Eraser"]
```

*Adding an Item to an Exisiting Array*
```swift
items += "Crayons"
```
