## About the language

> _Describe the language_
>
> - History:

Swift is a general purpose, open source programming lanuage that was developed by Apple for iOS, macOS, and Linux. Swift is a fairly new language as it was started by Chris Lattner in 2010. This language got its ideas from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python and C# to name a few. The language was officially used with the first app written in Swift in 2014. Prior to Swift, Apple was using Objective-C as their preferred language.

Swift is an alternative language to Objective-C, but has simpler syntax. They say its Obective-C without the "C".
